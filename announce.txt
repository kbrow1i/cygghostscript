The following packages have been uploaded to the Cygwin distribution:

* ghostscript-9.25-1
* libgs9-9.25-1

GNU Ghostscript is a PostScript interpreter capable of converting PS
files into a number of printer output formats.  Ghostscript can also
render PS files into a number of graphics file formats.

This is an update to the latest upstream release.  It is a bugfix
release, to fix some bugs that were introduced in ghostcript-9.24.
